   abstract = {Accurate identification of siblings through face recognition is a challenging task. This is predominantly because of the high degree of similarities among the faces of siblings. In this study, we investigate the use of state-of-the-art deep learning face recognition models to evaluate their capacity for discrimination between sibling faces using various similarity indices. The specific models examined for this purpose are FaceNet, VGGFace, VGG16, and VGG19. For each pair of images provided, the embeddings have been calculated using the chosen deep learning model. Five standard similarity measures, namely, cosine similarity, Euclidean distance, structured similarity, Manhattan distance, and Minkowski distance, are used to classify images looking for their identity on the threshold defined for each of the similarity measures. The accuracy, precision, and misclassification rate of each model are calculated using standard confusion matrices. Four different experimental datasets for full-frontal-face, eyes, nose, and forehead of sibling pairs are constructed using publicly available HQf subset of the SiblingDB database. The experimental results show that the accuracy of the chosen deep learning models to distinguish siblings based on the full-frontal-face and cropped face areas vary based on the face area compared. It is observed that VGGFace is best while comparing the full-frontal-face and eyes—the accuracy of classification being with more than 95% in this case. However, its accuracy degrades significantly when the noses are compared, while FaceNet provides the best result for classification based on the nose. Similarly, VGG16 and VGG19 are not the best models for classification using the eyes, but these models provide favorable results when foreheads are compared.},

@article{CombiningCNN,
   abstract = {Recently, a common starting point for solving complex unsupervised image classification tasks is to use generic features, extracted with deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) pretrained on a large and versatile dataset (ImageNet). However, in most research, the CNN architecture for feature extraction is chosen arbitrarily, without justification. This paper aims at providing insight on the use of pretrained CNN features for image clustering (IC). First, extensive experiments are conducted and show that, for a given dataset, the choice of the CNN architecture for feature extraction has a huge impact on the final clustering. These experiments also demonstrate that proper extractor selection for a given IC task is difficult. To solve this issue, we propose to rephrase the IC problem as a multi-view clustering (MVC) problem that considers features extracted from different architectures as different “views” of the same data. This approach is based on the assumption that information contained in the different CNN may be complementary, even when pretrained on the same data. We then propose a multi-input neural network architecture that is trained end-to-end to solve the MVC problem effectively. This approach is tested on nine natural image datasets, and produces state-of-the-art results for IC.},

@article{IECNN,
   abstract = {In the field of face recognition, similar face recognition is difficult due to the high degree of similarity of the face structure. The following two factors are needed to make progress in this field: (i) the availability of large scale similar face training datasets, and (ii) a fine-grained face recognition method. With the above factors fulfilled, we make two contributions. First, we show how a large scale similar face dataset (SFD) can be assembled by a combination of automation and human in the loop, and divide the dataset into five grades according to different degrees of similarity. Second, a new fine-grained face feature extraction method is proposed to solve this problem using the attention mechanism which combines the Internal Features and External Features. The Labeled Faces in the Wild (LFW) database, CASIA-WebFace and similar face dataset (SFD) were selected for experiments. It turns out that the true positive rate is improved by 1.94 - 5.66% and the recognition accuracy rate improved by 2.08 - 5.8% for the LFW and CASIA-WebFace database, respectively. Meanwhile for SFD, the recognition accuracy rate improved by 18.80 - 35.84%.},

@article{Yang2018,
   abstract = {In the big data era, the data are generated from different sources or observed from different views. These data are referred to as multi-view data. Unleashing the power of knowledge in multi-view data is very important in big data mining and analysis. This calls for advanced techniques that consider the diversity of different views, while fusing these data. Multi-view Clustering (MvC) has attracted increasing attention in recent years by aiming to exploit complementary and consensus information across multiple views. This paper summarizes a large number of multi-view clustering algorithms, provides a taxonomy according to the mechanisms and principles involved, and classifies these algorithms into five categories, namely, co-training style algorithms, multi-kernel learning, multiview graph clustering, multi-view subspace clustering, and multi-task multi-view clustering. Therein, multi-view graph clustering is further categorized as graph-based, network-based, and spectral-based methods. Multi-view subspace clustering is further divided into subspace learning-based, and non-negative matrix factorization-based methods. This paper does not only introduce the mechanisms for each category of methods, but also gives a few examples for how these techniques are used. In addition, it lists some publically available multi-view datasets. Overall, this paper serves as an introductory text and survey for multi-view clustering.},

This emerging technique has reshaped the research landscape of face recognition (FR) since 2014, launched by the breakthroughs of DeepFace and DeepID. Since then, deep learning technique, characterized by the hierarchical architecture to stitch together pixels into invariant face representation, has dramatically improved the state-of-the-art performance and fostered successful real-world applications. In this survey, we provide a comprehensive review of the recent developments on deep FR, covering broad topics on algorithm designs, databases, protocols, and application scenes. First, we summarize different network architectures and loss functions proposed in the rapid evolution of the deep FR methods. Second, the related face processing methods are categorized into two classes: “one-to-many augmentation” and “many-to-one normalization”. Then, we summarize and compare the commonly used databases for both model training and evaluation. Third, we review miscellaneous scenes in deep FR, such as cross-factor, heterogenous, multiple-media and industrial scenes.

   abstract = {Abstract Face detection is one of the most studied topics in computer vision literature, not only because of the challenging nature of face as an object, but also due to the countless applications that require the application of face detection as a first step. During the past 15 years, tremendous progress has been made due to the availability of data in unconstrained capture conditions (so-called 'in-the-wild') through the Internet, the effort made by the community to develop publicly available benchmarks, as well as the progress in the development of robust computer vision algorithms. In this paper, we survey the recent advances in real-world face detection techniques, beginning with the seminal Viola-Jones face detector methodology. These techniques are roughly categorized into two general schemes: rigid templates, learned mainly via boosting based methods or by the application of deep neural networks, and deformable models that describe the face by its parts. Representative methods will be described in detail, along with a few additional successful methods that we briefly go through at the end. Finally, we survey the main databases used for the evaluation of face detection algorithms and recent benchmarking efforts, and discuss the future of face detection.},

Face detection is a necessary first-step in face recognition systems, with the purpose of localizing and extracting the face region from the background. It also has several applications in areas such as content-based image retrieval, video coding, video conferencing, crowd surveillance, and intelligent human-computer interfaces. However, it was not until recently that the face detection problem received considerable attention among researchers. The human face is a dynamic object and has a high degree of variability in its appearance, which makes face detection a difficult problem in computer vision. A wide variety of techniques have been proposed, ranging from simple edge-based algorithms to composite high-level approaches utilizing advanced pattern recognition methods. The algorithms presented in this paper are classified as either feature-based or image-based and are discussed in terms of their technical approach and performance. Due to the lack of standardized tests, we do not provide a comprehensive comparative evaluation, but in cases where results are reported on common datasets, comparisons are presented. We also give a presentation of some proposed applications and possible application areas.},

In particular, our framework adopts a cascaded structure with three stages of carefully designed deep convolutional networks that predict face and landmark location in a coarse-to-fine manner. In addition, in the learning process, we propose a new online hard sample mining strategy that can improve the performance automatically without manual sample selection.

The perception of a novel configuration in such composite stimuli is sufficiently convincing to interfere with identification of the constituent parts (experiment 1), but this effect disappears when stimuli are inverted (experiment 2). Difficulty in identifying the parts of upright composites is found even for stimuli made from parts of unfamiliar faces that have only ever been encountered as face fragments (experiment 3). An equivalent effect is found for composites made from internal and external facial features of well-known people (experiment 4). These findings demonstrate the importance of configurational information in face perception, and that configurations are only properly perceived in upright faces.},

   abstract = {The perception and recognition of familiar faces depends critically on an analysis of the internal features of the face (eyes, nose, mouth). We therefore contrasted how information about the internal and external (hair, chin, face outline) features of familiar and unfamiliar faces is represented in face-selective regions. There was a significant response to both the internal and external features of the face when presented in isolation. However, the response to the internal features was greater than the response to the external features. There was significant adaptation to repeated images of either the internal or external features of the face in the fusiform face area (FFA). However, the magnitude of this adaptation was greater for the internal features of familiar faces. Next, we asked whether the internal features of the face are represented independently from the external features. There was a release from adaptation in the FFA to composite images in which the internal features were varied but the external features were unchanged, or when the internal features were unchanged but the external features varied, demonstrating a holistic response. Finally, we asked whether the holistic response to faces could be influenced by the context in which the face was presented. We found that adaptation was still evident to composite images in which the face was unchanged but body features were varied. Together, these findings show that although internal features are important in the neural representation of familiar faces, the face's internal and external features are represented holistically in face-selective regions of the human brain.},

measure the accuracy of a method. Given a set of true clusters, and the set of

many contexts, for example assigning a value of 0 where the two sets are
totally dissimilar, and 1 where they are identical. A measure based on
normalized mutual information, [1], has recently become popular. We demonstrate
