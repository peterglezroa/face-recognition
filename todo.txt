Datasets
1.- (done) Scripts to obtain n amount of images of each specific dataset
2.- (done) Display a list of images from csv

Face detection
(Compare mtcnn vs dlib)
3.- (done) Script to detect and focus on a face.
4.- [optional] Fragment the face in 3 different sections that will enter as distinct

Face recognition models
4.- (done) Obtain atleast 5 models with pretrained values
5.- Score on atleast 2 datasets
6.- (done) Train if it is needed and then Score to compare
7.- [optional] Obtain face mask model with pretrained values

CC
8.- (done) Remove softmax from previous models
9.- (done) Make CC model 1 with kmeans
10.- (done) Make CC model 2 with kmeans and PCA
