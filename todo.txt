Datasets
1.- (done) Scripts to obtain n amount of images of each specific dataset
2.- Display a list of images from csv

Face detection
(Compare mtcnn vs dlib)
3.- (done) Script to detect and focus on a face.
4.- [optional] Fragment the face in 3 different sections that will enter as distinct

Face recognition models
4.- Obtain atleast 5 models with pretrained values
5.- Score on atleast 2 datasets
6.- Train if it is needed and then Score to compare
7.- [optional] Obtain face mask model with pretrained values

MVC
7.- Remove softmax from previous models
8.- Make CC model 1 with kmeans
9.- Make CC model 2 with kmeans and PCA
10.- Make MVC model 1 with multiview kmeans
11.- Make MVC model 2 with multiview kmeans and PCA
12.- Make MVC model 2 with FRMVK
13.- Investigate about JULE and implement it

Results
14.- Compare results with each database, denoting databases features like pixeled or in the wild
15.- Compare time taken per model
